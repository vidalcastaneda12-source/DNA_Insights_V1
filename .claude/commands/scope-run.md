Run the per-scope agent team (finding-034) for one ROADMAP scope item, end to
end, stopping at each of the two human gates. Argument: a scope id (e.g.
`PR-6`), optionally followed by `--from <stage>` to resume after a gate.

This command is the **model-driven orchestrator** — the runnable-today path. The
team's members live in `.claude/agents/*.md` and are usable standalone; this
command sequences them with **adaptive depth** and threads each member's
structured JSON output to the next. You (the lead session) spawn each member via
the **Task tool** with the matching `subagent_type`, collect its JSON, and route
per the rules below. You never auto-approve a plan and never merge; those are the
two human gates.

## Two orchestration paths (pick one)

- **This command (`/scope-run`) — model-driven.** Works today; rides the Task
  tool. Flexible (the session interprets the routing rules each run) but
  non-deterministic. Use this as the default and as the fallback whenever the JS
  workflow runtime is unavailable.
- **The JS workflows — deterministic.** `.claude/workflows/{plan-phase,
  implement-review,close}.js` encode the same pipeline as deterministic control
  flow, segmented by the two gates (`/plan-phase PR-6` → gate → `/implement-review
  PR-6` → gate → `/close PR-6`). Prefer these once the dynamic-workflows
  subagent-invocation primitive is confirmed in your runtime (they isolate that
  one call behind `runAgent()` and fail loud if it's absent — see
  `.claude/agents/README.md`). Same members, same depth, same gates as below.

Either way the guardrail **hooks are live** (`.claude/settings.json`): the
`implementer` / `schema-change-executor` cannot edit `docs/schemas/`|`ddl/`
without `GENOME_ALLOW_SCHEMA_CHANGE=1`, no member can `git add -A`, and commits
get GATE-FILL / CHANGELOG nudges.

## Operating rules

- **Spawn members via Task** with `subagent_type` = the agent file name. Pass the
  upstream JSON the member needs as its prompt input. Run independent members
  **in parallel** (multiple Task calls in one message): the N planners, the
  per-axis judges, the review lenses, the verifier skeptics.
- **Thread the JSON.** Each stage consumes the prior stage's structured output.
  Keep the manifest as the shared source of truth throughout.
- **Respect the two human gates.** Stop and present to VSC-User after Stage 1
  (plan approval) and after Stage 4 (merge verification). Do not proceed past a
  gate on your own; resume with `--from stage2` / `--from stage5`.
- **Bounded loops.** Plan revise loop: ×2 then escalate. Review fix-first loop:
  ×2 then escalate. Stage 3 completeness loop: until-dry (K=2).
- **Read vs write.** Only Stage 2 writers (`implementer`, `test-author`,
  `schema-change-executor`, `fan-out-implementer`) and Stage 5
  `knowledge-curator` may edit. Everyone else is read-only. Never hand the
  `test-author` the implementation diff.
- **Over-tier when unsure.** If the dispatcher's tier is borderline, run the
  deeper tier.

## Stage 0 — Intake

1. Spawn `scope-dispatcher` with the scope id. Collect the **scope manifest**
   (including `risk_tier`, `risk_breakdown`, `review_lenses`, `deep_T2`,
   `applicable_anchors`, `precedent`, `freshness_flags`, `open_questions`).
2. If `freshness_flags` or `open_questions` are non-empty, surface them now (they
   warn; they don't block).
3. The `risk_tier` selects depth for every downstream stage (table below).

## Stage 0.5 — Split check

Before planning the scope as a monolith, run the `scope-split` smart-cut split check (Sub
Project B2 Phase 1, `finding-039`) over the Stage-0 manifest via `genome scope-split check
--manifest -` (feeding the manifest on stdin), the detector behind the `/scope-split` skill.
The `scope-split` detector is **manifest-primary + fail-closed** — atomic is the default, and a
split is proposed only when a candidate cut survives every gate.

- **Atomic** (`atomic — no split`) → proceed to Stage 1 unchanged. This is the common case
  (a tight cluster like PR-3 / PR-5a is correctly indivisible).
- **Clean split** → present the 🚦 **pre-plan micro-gate**: "PR-X is really these N ordered
  PRs" — the ordered sub-scopes with each `origin_scope`, change classes, estimated footprint,
  re-scored tier, and the cut-quality line. Ask VSC-User to **approve / edit / run-as-one**.
  **Stop for the human.** Do not proceed to Stage 1 on your own; the split check is advisory
  and never auto-runs a sub-scope or crosses a gate.

This split check is advisory: it never writes ROADMAP (except via the explicit `genome
scope-split write-roadmap` on approval) and never crosses a gate.

## Stage 1 — Plan

By tier:
- **Tier 0:** 1 `planner` (minimal-diff) → `plan-premortem` (1) → `plan-auditor`.
- **Tier 1:** 2 `planner`s (minimal-diff + gate-backward) in parallel →
  `plan-judges` (light, all axes) → `plan-synthesizer` → `plan-premortem` (1) →
  `plan-auditor` panel (contract + architecture-fit).
- **Tier 2:** full panel of `planner`s (minimal-diff, gate-backward, risk-first,
  convention-purist) in parallel → per-axis `plan-judges` (one per axis, in
  parallel) → `plan-synthesizer` → `plan-premortem` (2 skeptics; 3 if `deep_T2`)
  → `plan-auditor` panel + `architect-reviewer`.

The `plan-auditor` verdict routes: `ready` → the human gate; `revise` → back to
the planner(s) with findings (bounded ×2 → escalate); `escalate` → VSC-User.

**→ HUMAN GATE 1.** Present to VSC-User: the synthesized plan; its **merged
riskiest-assumptions** (first); the **divergence** open questions; the
**predicted surprises** (incl. any `probe-first`). Stop. Do not implement until
VSC-User approves.

## Stage 2 — Implement (after plan approval)

1. **interface-freeze:** have `implementer` declare public signatures / CLI /
   columns as skeleton stubs (or confirm the plan pins them).
2. In parallel: `test-author` (PLAN-BLIND — give it the plan §5/§6 + the frozen
   interface + `predicted_surprises`, **never the diff**) writes the red tests;
   `implementer` fills bodies.
3. `plan-adherence-sentinel` watches the diff; drift → PAUSE + escalate.
4. Green loop: `green-keeper` runs `pytest · ruff check · ruff format --check ·
   mypy --strict backend/src` after each change. On real red → `test-triage` →
   (`deep-debugger` if gnarly). A green-fix needing a weakened test / schema
   touch → escalate.
5. Side-channels: if `change_class ⊇ schema` → `schema-change-executor` runs the
   rebuild protocol; if `blast_radius` wide & independent →
   `fan-out-implementer` units in worktrees.
6. Exit when dev-loop green ∧ sentinel clean ∧ coverage-of-plan complete.

Depth: Tier 0 = `implementer` + `green-keeper`; Tier 1 = + `test-author` +
`sentinel` + `silent-failure-hunter` (in-loop); Tier 2 = + `test-triage` +
`deep-debugger` on standby + the side-channels.

## Stage 3 — Review fan-out

1. Spawn the **lenses gated by `manifest.review_lenses`** in parallel, each blind
   to the others, each seeing the **diff** not the implementer's reasoning:
   `/code-review` (skill, always), `convention-compliance`, plus the full set at
   Tier 1+ (`test-integrity`, `silent-failure-hunter`, `type-design-analyzer`,
   `pr-test-analyzer`, `comment-analyzer`, `architect-reviewer`). Factor-gated
   regardless of tier: `phi-pii-guardian` on any data/privacy surface,
   `regression-hunter` whenever anchors ≥ 1. `/security-review` runs alongside
   `phi-pii-guardian` when the diff warrants it. Give `test-integrity` the
   Stage-2 test→spec provenance and `regression-hunter` the `predicted_surprises`.
2. As each lens completes, feed its findings to `finding-verifier`
   (refute-by-default; blocker → 2–3 distinct-angle skeptics in parallel; warn →
   1; nit → logged, not verified). For sweep-shaped scope with heavy cross-lens
   overlap, dedup **before** the verifier.
3. Tier 1+: `completeness-critic` loops-until-dry (K=2).
4. `review-synthesizer` produces the **pre-gate package**: verdict, ranked
   verified blockers/warns, nits appendix, **anchors-to-watch (with expected
   values)**, correctness attestation, residual risk.

Route: `fix-first` → back to Stage 2 (bounded ×2 → escalate); `go` → Stage 4.

## Stage 4 — Handoff

Spawn `handoff-assembler`: it wraps `/handoff` + `/changelog` + (`/new-finding`)
— gathering git/gh facts verbatim — and appends the Agent-team pre-gate appendix
(verdict, anchors-to-watch with expected values, residual risk, surviving
predicted surprises, schema-rebuild steps if `change_class ⊇ schema`). Run
`/pr-ready` as the in-loop dry-run of the merge-gate contract before presenting.

**→ HUMAN GATE 2.** VSC-User runs `docs/runbooks/verification.md` independently,
confirms the anchors-to-watch on real data, and merges (or bounces to Stage 2).
Stop. The team does not merge.

**Evidence-gated merge (Sub Project A — `finding-037`).** Once the
`/verify-and-merge` skill (`.claude/commands/verify-and-merge.md`) is in place, a
**future** scope may take the owner-approved evidence-gated path instead of the
manual run above: Claude runs the same protocol through the fail-closed
`genome.verify_gate` core, presents the raw evidence, takes a typed approval, then
squash-merges and closes. The independent human run stays the standing fallback, so
"the team does not merge" holds until that typed approval is given. **Temporal split:**
the Sub-A PR that introduces the skill lands through **this** existing Gate 2 (the
operator merges it by hand); the skill governs the merge of subsequent scopes, not its
own introduction.

## Stage 5 — Close (after VSC-User merges, or after the evidence-gated merge)

1. `knowledge-curator` re-locks the anchors **VSC-User confirmed at the gate**
   into `CLAUDE.md` / `verification.md` / the finding's bedrock table, flips the
   ROADMAP slot, adds cross-links, and appends/flips the scope's `DEC-NNNN`
   `MEMORY.md` rows (insert-then-flip, `genome docs check` clean) — into a
   **reviewable doc change**, never a direct push, human-confirmed numbers only.
2. `repo-sweep` (whole-repo) files residual staleness to the backlog
   (non-blocking), including the **missing-DEC-row** check (`genome docs check`).

This closes the anchor loop: predict (Stage 1) → flag with expected values
(Stage 3) → confirm on real data (gate) → record (Stage 5).

## Depth quick-reference

| Tier | Plan | Implement | Review |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 planner + pre-mortem + auditor | implementer + green-keeper | code-review + convention; single verify |
| 1 | 2 planners + light judge + pre-mortem + auditor panel | + test-author + sentinel + silent-failure | full lens set + 3-skeptic verify + loop-until-dry |
| 2 | full panel + per-axis judges + multi-skeptic pre-mortem + auditor panel + architect-reviewer | + test-triage + deep-debugger + schema-executor / fan-out | all lenses + 3-skeptic verify + completeness-critic |

This table is the recalibrated adaptive-depth table (finding-034); the JS
workflows implement the same depths.
