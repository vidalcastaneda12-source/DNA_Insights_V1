"""The fail-closed verdict reduction for the agentic verify-and-merge gate (``finding-037``).

Reduces an :class:`~genome.verify_gate.model.EvidencePackage` to a single three-valued
:class:`~genome.verify_gate.model.Verdict`. This is where every decidable check is graded,
so the bash skill's only gate can be "core exited non-zero → stop". **No** :mod:`genome.db`
import — the reduction is pure data → verdict.

Reduction rule (``UNKNOWN`` dominates ``BLOCKED`` dominates ``GREEN``):

* :attr:`~genome.verify_gate.model.Verdict.GREEN` **iff** every step is ``PASS`` ∧ every
  non-deferred anchor matches (``expected`` and ``actual`` both present and equal) ∧
  ``changelog_present`` ∧ ``docs_check_clean`` ∧ ``¬weakened_or_removed_test`` ∧
  ``¬gate_fill_survivor`` ∧ the test count is decided and non-decreasing ∧
  ``¬rebuild_pending``. An empty anchor set with everything else affirmative is GREEN (the
  N/A path).
* Any decided failure (step ``FAIL``, anchor mismatch, weakened test, surviving gate-fill,
  missing CHANGELOG, dirty docs check, negative test delta) → ``BLOCKED``.
* Any undecidable signal (step ``UNKNOWN``, non-deferred anchor with a ``None`` side, a
  ``None`` test count, ``rebuild_pending``) → ``UNKNOWN``.
* When both an ``UNKNOWN`` and a ``BLOCKED`` condition fire, ``UNKNOWN`` wins.
